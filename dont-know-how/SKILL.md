description: Find direction for a task you don't know how to start. Scans the repo, asks for what the user holds, gathers evidence, and returns at least three grounded approaches.

The user faces a task they cannot start: an unfamiliar system, protocol, library, or integration. Your deliverable is **direction**, given in the conversation: at least three evidenced approaches, with a recommendation. Implementation is out of scope; stop once the directions are delivered.

One rule governs every step: **evidence, never guesswork**. Every claim carries a locator: a `path:line`, a URL, a document section, or a user statement. A fact you could not establish is reported as unknown, not filled in.

## 1. Scan the repo

Extract the **keywords** from the prompt: the named system, its synonyms, the protocols and standards it implies, and the vendor or product names. "101 AD server" expands to Active Directory, LDAP, LDAPS, Kerberos, domain, bind, and the names of libraries the project's language uses for them.

Search with the strongest tool the environment offers: a code knowledge graph when the project has one, otherwise whatever file and content search is available. Cover code, configuration, dependency manifests, and documentation. Look for what the project already owns that touches the task: existing modules, config entries, installed packages, README sections, prior notes.

Done when every asset found is listed with its locator, or the absence of anything relevant is stated plainly.

## 2. Ask what the user holds

Ask only for what search cannot reach: documents from the counterpart, sample code, test environments and credentials, contacts, and constraints. Build the round from [`references/questions.md`](references/questions.md): pick the template matching the task shape, drop questions the scan already answered, and word each remaining question in the task's own terms.

Then wait for the answer.

- The user has nothing: go to step 3.
- The user supplies material: read all of it first. Where it leaves a gap the directions would depend on, ask a follow-up round aimed at that gap alone. Repeat until the material is sufficient or the user has nothing more, then go to step 3.

## 3. Gather evidence yourself

Work in this order:

1. **Project dependencies.** Read the manifest and lockfile; a package already installed may cover the need.
2. **Official sources.** Vendor documentation, specifications, RFCs, library documentation.
3. **Community sources**, only for what official sources leave open: Q&A sites, blogs, forums, issue trackers.

Community material is a lead, never a conclusion. Cross-check it against an official source or a second independent source, check its date against the versions in play, and discard what conflicts or has aged out. Record a locator for everything kept.

Done when every candidate direction rests on sources you can cite, and every open point is named as unknown.

## 4. Return the directions

Reply in the conversation with at least three directions. For each:

- what it is, in a sentence or two
- the evidence it rests on, with locators
- strengths and weaknesses
- when it fits
- what remains unconfirmed, and who or what can confirm it

Close with your recommendation and the reason. Then stop; choosing is the user's decision.
