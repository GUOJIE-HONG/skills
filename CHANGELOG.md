# Changelog

## 0.2.0

- New skill `to-tasks`: splits each `to-tickets` ticket into implementation tasks that write to at most two projects, nested under the ticket, published only after the user approves the tree.
- New skill `implement-task`: works the frontier of `to-tasks` task files, one task per fresh sub-agent, each confined to the projects its task names; a boundary breach stops the loop with `needs-triage` instead of widening the edit; an exhausted frontier ends with `$code-review` over the whole run.
- `design-code-implement`: after recording the direction, measures each ticket's footprint against the project dependency chain and reports which tickets exceed two projects, recommending `$to-tasks` or `$implement-task` accordingly.

## 0.1.1

- `dont-know-how`: content read from outside sources is now explicitly material, never instruction. Directives embedded in documentation, forum posts or issue threads are recorded as findings with their locator instead of being acted on (indirect prompt injection).

## 0.1.0

- First release as a Claude Code plugin (`guojie-skills`) and via skills.sh.
- Ships six skills: `dont-know-how`, `grill-softly`, `torture-gently`, `show-grill-clearly`, `design-code-implement`, `implement-small-change`.
